rpm-kickstart
============

Redmine Ticket: #4409

This test fixture was derived from the F29 ISO. Mounted, all content was copied
and the following information was removed:
- RPMs: Lots of unneeded size andthese caused issues with other tests in test_copy 
  in the test fixture. 
  Removed all RPMS to resolve unneeded possibility of cross-test contamination.
- IMG: All .img files were replaced with `dd if=/dev/zero of=$file bs=1M count=1` 
  replacements. Testing does not care about contents, only the files being copied.
  There are a total of (6) .img files
- PULP_DISTRIBUTION.xml: Added to have the isolinx/* directory contents copied on
  sync of the repo. Else, this content was skipped (and the img files).
- repodata/: Regenerated the repodata dir with all the RPMs removed. Note there 
  is nothing in the package list. Used createrepo_c to re-generate locally and 
  then copied to the test fixture.

The test fixture can have all other extraneous files removed. However, these files
have been left at this time as they are small and not causing issues. This fixture 
better represents a kickstart dir in this configuration.

This should be the final configuration of this hand-crafted fixture. An issue in
pulp-fixtures has been created [0] to track adding this to the auto-generated
fixtures creation.
